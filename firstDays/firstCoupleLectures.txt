Printing
printf(string, arguments)
String is displayed
Arguments are the values that will be displayed along with the string
%d placeholder for signed integer
%c character
%u for unsigned integer and so on
Example program:

#include <stdio.h>
int main ( void )
{
   int a = 3;
   printf ( " 1+2 = % d and % d +% d = 9\n " , a , a , 2* a );
   return 0;
}
 


Operators
Following bedmas rules
() priority
% int division
*multiply
/ div
+/- plus/minus
Examples of division
	10/3 returns 3
	10%3 returns 1
	10.0/3 will return 3.333333

Assignment Operators
Basically done last in the order of operations
Evaluates everything to the right first
var=expr
a+=2 is a=a+2
a*=b+c is a=a*(b+c)
Incremental operators
Two types: prefix and suffix
		a++ uses a first and then increments by 1
		a- - uses a first then decreases a by 1
++a increments a by 1 first then uses a possibly
- -a decreases a by 1 first then uses a possibly 

*printf returns the integer number of characters 

#include <stdio.h>
int main ( void ) {
   int x=10;
   int y=printf("%d %d\n",printf("%d ",x),x*4);
   printf("%d\n",y);
   return 0;
}

Prints 
10 3 40
5

Starting from printf(“%d “,x) ->
x=10 which holds 2 characters

Relational and logical operators
    Relational operators (<,>,<=,>=) take lower precedence than artihmetic and are left associateive
    Equality operators ==,!= take lower precedence than relational operators and are left associateive
Logical Operators   
    ! negation is right associative and has the same precedence as unary + or -.
    || and && are logical or and respectively, are left associative and are lower than Equality

#include < tdio.h>
   int main ( void ) {
   int i ;
   printf ( " Enter an integer between 1 and 3. " );
   scanf ( " % d " ,& i );
   switch ( i ){
      case 1:
      printf ( " is the loneliest number \n " );
      break ;
      case 2: printf ( " , an even prime \n " );
      //Since the break statement is missing, the code will execute all of the subsequential lines. 
      case 3: printf ( " is a crowd \n " ); break ;
      default : printf ( " illegal entry \n " ); break ;
   }
   return 0;
}

- An if, else, else if statement with no braces matches with the subsequential line only.
