Arrays

Arrays are used to store multiple values into one array variable. 
Its index starts at 0 and ends a 1 less than the length of the array.

Creating Arrays
• int a[5] = {10,-7,3,8,42}
• int a[] = {10,-7,3,8,42} (size is inferred)
• int a[5] = {1,2,3} (last two entries are 0 by default)
• int a[5] = {0} (creates an all 0 array)
• int a[5] (uninitialized array contains garbage entries)
• int a[5] = {[2] = 2, [4] = 3123} (specified the third
and fifth entries - rest are 0)
