in a for loop --- for(expr 1; expr 2; expr 3){}

The sequence is as follows: expr1 (once), then check expr 2, followed by the code in the loops, then execute expression 3 and repeat

C supports break; and continue; keywords that will terminate a function or pass it onto the next iteration respectively

for example:

break ->
for(int x;x<10;x++){
    break;
}
this will immediately terminate the loop

continue ->

for(int x;x<10;x++){
    continue;
}
The loop will iterate 10 times in this case 

the 'goto' keyword allows you to go to a specfic point in the code
